# Schema Evolution Analyzer

The Schema Evolution Analyzer is a tool that helps you understand and manage changes in your database schema over time. It provides insights into the impact of schema changes on existing queries and applications, making it easier to evolve your database schema with confidence.

## Features

- Analyze schema evolution patterns and detect potential issues
- Identify queries and applications affected by schema changes
- Suggest optimizations and modifications for impacted queries
- Integrate with your existing database change management process
- Provide a standalone version for quick and easy analysis

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- PostgreSQL (if using the PostgreSQL storage backend)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/schema-evolution-analyzer.git
   cd schema-evolution-analyzer
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
### Configuration 
1. Create a copy of the config.example.yaml file and rename it to config.yaml:
    ```bash
    cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
    ```
2. Open config.yaml and modify the configuration settings according to your environment.

### Usage

1. Import the necessary classes in your Python script:
    ```python
    from schema_analyzer import SchemaEvolutionAnalyzer, AnalyzerConfig
    ```
2. Load the configuration and create an instance of the analyzer:
    ```python
    config = AnalyzerConfig.from_file("config.yaml")
    analyzer = SchemaEvolutionAnalyzer(config)
    ```
3. Analyze your schema evolution:
    ```python
    result = analyzer.analyze_evolution(old_schema, new_schema)
    print(result)
    ```

### Running Tests
To run the test suite, use the following command:

    ```bash
    pytest tests/
    ```

    This enhanced README.md provides a clear and concise overview of the Schema Evolution Analyzer, including its features, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and information on running tests. It also includes a suggested repository structure that organizes the project's code, tests, and documentation in a logical manner.

    The repository structure separates the main package code into the `schema_analyzer/` directory, with submodules for different functionalities like the analyzer, configuration, models, storage backends, and utility functions. The `tests/` directory contains the test cases for the package.

    The README.md also provides instructions on how to configure the analyzer using a configuration file and includes an example of how to use the analyzer in a Python script.

    Feel free to further customize the README.md and repository structure based on your specific project requirements and preferences.
